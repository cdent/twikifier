# What

This is a first pass at creating node.js-based wikifier for wikitext
formatted as TiddlyWiki text.

Rather than creating new code this code simply assembles the required
parts from the TiddlyWiki
[core code repository](http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/core/js/) along
with the necessary bits of additional JavaScript. This means that as
the TiddlyWiki core changes this code automatically keeps up to date.

By using jsdom and htmlparser with node, it is possible to simulate the
browser environment that the wikifier would normally run in, and create
some HTML output.

# How

(The below is for OS X but should transliterate to other environments.  It has also been tested on Ubuntu 12.04)

Install node.js and its package manager npm. If you are using brew that
goes like this:

    brew install node npm

Once you have npm, install grunt with:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Then install the project dependencies:

    npm install

In the repo directory run:

    grunt

This will get all the necessary TiddlyWiki code and concatenate it into
`dist/twikifier.js`.  The grunt test task is run after this and runs all the files in the `test/files`
directory against twikifier via `test/twikify/js`.

The task also creates a distributable node application in `bin/server.js`.

## Testing

From the test directory, you can try your own wikitext by piping data into twikify on STDIN:

    node twikify.js --collection=<url for tiddler collection> < /tmp/mysampledata.txt

or by giving the names of multiple files on the command line:

    node twikify.js --collection=<url for tiddler collection> /tmp/mysampledata.txt \
        /tmp/someotherdata.txt

`<url for tiddler collection>` should be replaced with the url of a collection
of tiddlers, in JSON, as found in TiddlyWeb. Things like:

    http://cdent-test7.tiddlyspace.com/bags/cdent-test7_public/tiddlers
    http://cdent-test7.tiddlyspace.com/recipes/cdent-test7_public/tiddlers

As the tool develops there will be other interfaces.

# Testing the NPM Package Works

From the repo directory run:

    npm pack

This will create a zipped tarball.  Install this tarball as follows:

    npm install -g twikifier-x.y.z.tgz

If all is well, `twikifier` will be available in your path.  Run this to check twikifier works.

# Releasing the NPM Package

Run:

    grunt release

See [this link](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-release#readme) for how this works.

# Use with TiddlyWeb and Tiddlyspace

Install the TiddlyWeb plugin:

    pip install -U tiddlywebplugins.twikified

Add the following to tiddlywebconfig.py:

    'wikitext.default_renderer': 'tiddlywebplugins.twikified'

Install this package via NPM then run the twikifier server:

    npm install -g twikifier
    twikifier /tmp/wst.sock

Then start TiddlyWeb/Tiddlyspace

If you have connection problems after a restart, remove `/tmp/wst.sock` and try again.

To permantly run twikifier, see the next section.

## Start-up Script

To have twikifier automatically run on start-up and to give more control over starting and stopping it:

Copy the file `scripts/twikifier` to `/etc/init.d/`

Test it can start and stop:

	sudo /etc/init.d/twikifier start
	sudo /etc/init.d/twikifier stop
	sudo /etc/init.d/twikifier restart
	
Enable the script to start-up automatically on boot:

	update-rc.d twikifier defaults

Credit goes to https://github.com/chovy/node-startup for this.

###Socket File Location

By default, twikifier expects the socket file to live in `/var/run/twikifier`.
Create this folder, making sure the user running twikifier can read/write:

    mkdir /var/run/twikifier
    chown user.user /var/run/twikifier

To use another location, add the absolute path as an argument to twikifier in the start-up script.

# Why

TiddlyWeb and friends use [WikklyText](http://wikklytext.com/) to do sever-side
rendering of TiddlyWiki text to HTML. It works, but not great. It has long been
thought that a transcoding of the TiddlyWiki wikifier would a) work better,
b) be easier to extend and modify.

Also see the next section.

# Comments

In order to get the TiddlyWiki wikifier to work standalone, a great deal
of the TiddlyWiki code is required. Have a look at `TWREMOTES` in the
`Makefile` and the comments in `TwikifierBase.js`. The general overview
comment is that TiddlyWiki is non-functional: meaning its modules and methods
are tightly coupled with others, have many side effects and make use of 
data from globals rather than passed in parameters. This means that independent
code reuse is nigh on impossible.

That this is true is neither surprising, nor damning: TiddlyWiki was originally
built as a single file application. However since there is code in
there that could be useful if extracted and abstracted, hopefully this work
can point out some of the problems.

I tried to write down a simple dependency tree that explains how each
chunk of javascript requires another, but delineating the reasons got to be
too much so instead: What follows has less explanation than it could.

`twikifier` functionality currently lives in `twikify` and `TwikifierBase.js`.

`twikify` requires global `wikify()` in `Wikifier.js`.

`Wikifier.js` requires the global `formatter`, a `Formatter` from `FormatterHelpers.js`.

`FormatterHelpers.js` requires the global `config`, from `Config.js`.

A `Formatter` needs formatters, which are in `config` and defined in `Formatter.js`.

`Formatter.js` requires `FormatterHelper.js`, creating a cycle.

`Wikifier.js` requires global `createTiddlyText()`, from `Utilities.js`.

`Wikifier.js` requires global `createTiddlyElement()`, from `Utilities.js`.

`Formatter.js`, to format links, requires global `createTiddlyLink()` from `Utilities.js`.

`Utilities.js` requires the `pushUnique` modification to the `Array` prototype. This is found in `BasicTypes.js`.

`Formatter.js`, `FormatterHelpers.js`, `Utilities.js` all make use of a `store` global. A store, is a `TiddlyWiki` class, from `TiddlyWiki.js`.

`TiddlyWiki.js` calls `instanceof Tiddler` (4 times) and `new Tiddler` (twice), thus requiring `Tiddler.js`.

`Utilities.js` has `getTiddlyLinkInfo`, which requires `Lingo.js` for messages.
(`Lingo.js` requires `Config.js` and `Utilities.js` (for merge()).)

Presenting messages requires adding `format()` to the `String` prototype, thus requiring `Strings.js`.

This gets us to a working formatter, but not macros.

Adding `Macros.js` adds (limited, not yet tested) support for macros. `Macros.js` requires `Config.js`.

For macros to run, we need `invokeMacro`, which is from main.js. Rather
than including main.js (which has active code at the global level) I
made a copy of `invokeMacro`. It is not clear why the function definition
code is in main.

The difficulty here is not so much that there are a bunch of interdependencies,
but rather that the interdependencies are in the global scope and because
the files are simply building blocks for a single file, there are no clues
like import statements, namespaces, etc.

# Next

While the existing code will do basic rendering, to be truly useful
in a [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com/) situation, twikifier
needs two things:

* To present a web service or local socket that takes an input (a text
  string, a tiddler bag/title combo?) and returns the generated HTML.

* The Python code that provides the plugin hook for TiddlyWeb should live in a seperate repository
and be installed via pip.
